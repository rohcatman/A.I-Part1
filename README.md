## What is Behvaiour TreeðŸŒ²?

A behavior tree is a mathematical model of plan execution used in computer science, robotics, control systems and video games. 
Behavior trees originate from the computer game industry as a powerful tool to model the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs).

They have been extensively used in high-profile video games such as Halo, Bioshock, and Spore. Recent works propose behavior trees as a multi-mission control framework for UAV, complex robots, robotic manipulation, and multi-robot systems.

 
## Goal ðŸŒž 
This is a practice A.I project written by C# on Unity platform. Following on Unity Learn lecture(https://learn.unity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-beginners?uv=2020.2) to apply for my game.
